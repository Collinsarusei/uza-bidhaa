# **App Name**: NyeriConnect

## Core Features:

- User Authentication & KYC: Users can register using email/password or phone number with OTP verification, and upload ID and a selfie for KYC. Store KYC data in Firebase Storage.
- User Profiles: Users can create and manage their profiles, including updating profile pictures, bio, and contact information. Implement different user roles: Buyer, Seller, and Admin.
- Item Listings: Sellers can list items with details like title, description, images, price, category, and location. Buyers can view and filter items on the home screen.
- Real-Time Messaging: Buyers and sellers can communicate in real-time using Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore. Include features like message timestamps and typing indicators.
- Escrow Payment Integration: Implement an escrow payment system using Firebase Functions. Buyers pay through the app, and the money is held until the buyer confirms receipt. Admin can resolve disputes.
- Chatbot Assistant: Integrate a basic chatbot using Genkit to assist users with common FAQs. The chatbot is a tool that can answer questions like "How do I list an item?", "How does payment work?", and "How do I resolve a dispute?".
